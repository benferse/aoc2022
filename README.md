# Advent of Code - 2022 edition!

Working through this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), at least until I run out of steam :)

## Goals / themes for 2022

- Use [doc tests](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/write-documentation/documentation-tests.html) for verifying against examples
- Use `nightly` to mess around with new stuff
- Clarity over cleverness (evergreen, really)
