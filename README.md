# Advent of Code - 2022 edition!

Working through this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), at least until I run out of steam :)

## Goals / themes for 2022

- Use [doc tests](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/write-documentation/documentation-tests.html) for verifying against examples
- Use `nightly` to mess around with new stuff
- Parse stuff :) Several of the puzzles could easily have some or all of the input hard-coded, but parsing the input seems more interesting? /shrug
- Clarity over cleverness (evergreen, really)
